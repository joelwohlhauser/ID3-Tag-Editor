# ID3-Tag-Editor
With this simple program you can edit [ID3](https://id3.org/) tags and create playlists. 

[ID3](https://id3.org/) is a metadata container used in conjunction with the MP3 audio file format. It allows information such as the title, artist, album, track number, and other information about the file to be stored in the file itself. There are two unrelated versions of ID3: ID3v1 and ID3v2. **Both ID3v1 and ID3v2 can be edited with this program.**

This project was a school project and **will not be further developed**.
